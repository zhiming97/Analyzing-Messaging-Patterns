    This project attempts to visualize the chat patterns of two parties to extract some useful information where some parties will find it valuable.

<p align="justify">Youngsters prefer texting over calling. The way they text ranges from using a simple, one word message to long and complex texts. With the help of a Python module called "chat-miner", which enables the parsing of chat logs from WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, and Facebook Messenger into pandas dataframes, valuable information can extracted from their conversations when the textual data are being visualized. This Python module is able to visualise chat logs in the form of sunburst chart, calendar heatmap, and word cloud.  </p>

## Project Motivation 
The chat logs generated by users in messaging apps can be used to understand the behavioural data of the users which could be useful to certain parties

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Data Visualisation
### Heatmap: Message count per day

![Figure_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97498951/211147596-52fc71a0-7872-4ab9-85bc-07c18d4ad641.png)



  
 <br />
<p align="justify">
Based on the calendar heatmap shown above, it is known that the first conversation between the users started in 2015, on a Wednesday, in the first week of November. They started texting occasionally, averaging around less than 100 messages were exchanged per day. However, in 2016, there is an obvious drop in the number of times they texted each other throughout the year, except on the third week of December which saw a spike in messages exchanged. From then onwards, they rarely got into a conversation with each other throughout the year 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. Interestingly, in year 2022, both of them were messaging each other frequently starting at the end of September towards the end of the year.  </p>

### Wordcloud: Word frequencies

![Figure_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97498951/211146851-853c1648-7b9c-448c-be78-dc71fca686a2.png)

By looking at the wordcloud, it is known that most of the frequently used words are "say", "see", "ask", "come" etc. Unfortunately, these words do not show the context of their conversations.

However, when we look into the frequent appeared words from the end of September towards the end of the year (which is the period where they started to text each other frequently), it is found that words like "play", "Friday", "badminton", "book", "wat time" are among the frequently appeared words in their conversations. These words may be an indicator that maybe they could be making plans together (probably playing badminton).
